## 🖥️ Build
If you want to run this program in your local system, please follow this guide. 

### 1. Prerequisites

> Target Device: Android

> OS: Windows 10, macOS

#### Install "Flutter SDK"
- #### For [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive?tab=windows)
  
Remember to unpack the Flutter SDK file at the appropriate position. Do not unpack the file in folders like Program Files. <br/>
Ex) D:\flutter

Then, set the SDK path to the environment variable. You should set the variable to the path of flutter SDK’s bin folder.<br/>
Ex) D:\flutter\bin

- #### For [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive?tab=macos)
  
Open terminal and type commands below.

If your terminal is zsh,

	touch ~/.zshrc
	open ~/.zshrc

If your terminal is bash,

	touch ~/.bash_profile
	open ~/.bash_profile

Then a text editor will pop. You should add the code below with the address of YOUR Flutter SDK folder.

	export PATH=”$PATH:yourFlutterAddress/bin”
Save and close the editor.
<br/>
<br/>
For Windows and macOs, check whether you have completed all your tasks for using flutter with the command below.

	flutter doctor


#### Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install?hl=ko) 
#### Install "Flutter plugin & Dart plugin" in Android Studio
- #### For Windows
- #### For macOS

### 2. Clone the repository


    git clone https://github.com/CoolCoolCoffee/CoolCoolCoffee.git


This will create a local copy of the repository.

### 3. Build the project

To build Files for development, open the **CoolCoolCoffee_FrontEnd** package in Android Studio.

In the terminal, ‘flutter pub get’ is needed before running the program.

Now, Run the ‘main.dart’ and Enjoy our program!

(If you are using Android Emulator in Android Studio, you can’t use the camera so that you may not use ‘OCR’ function for menu logging automation.)


## 📌 Common Problems
We use the “Health Connect” app to connect our project with Samsung Health to get user's sleep information automatically. But “Health Connect” is still in beta, so it may not work properly in some cases. Therefore, if you can’t recall it, proceed with the setting again. If error occurs continuously, please record your sleep information by manual input and use the app.

## ⏰ Bug Reporting and Feature Request
